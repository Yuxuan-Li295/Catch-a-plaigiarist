1. Autograder is definitely a big thing. It's just too frustrating and 
exhausting.
2. Part1 reset and mark, next and has next, were a bit difficult because i'm 
not that familiar with readers.
3. Part 3 was difficult too but once I get the logic it's fine.

Can we make it easier to submmit homework and reduce the technnical 
difficulty level? There are so many potential ways for the autograder to
go wrong and most times it's not because of the code itself.
